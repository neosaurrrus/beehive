        Planning pokerÂ®, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based technique
        for estimating, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of user
        stories in software development. In planning poker, members of the group
        make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead
        of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are
        then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid
        the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud
        sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.
